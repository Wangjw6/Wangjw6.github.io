Jiawei Wang now is a postdoctoral researcher in [Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo](http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/). Wang received his PhD degree in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/), supervised by [Prof Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). 
During his PhD, he worked on traffic control with machine learning techniques, especially on [how to address bus bunching through multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://transitgym.github.io/). He received his B.E. and M.S. degrees from the Department of Intelligent Engineering at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/cn/index.htm), Guangzhou, China, where he mainly worked on urban network traffic prediction with deep learning.

### **My research interest**
#### **Data-Driven Traffic Understanding**
Leveraging data analytics and machine learning, my research has advanced the understanding of traffic dynamics and behaviors across macroscopic and microscopic scales:

2.2 **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) based research**:  

2.2.1 **Online Taxi Management**:  
- Applied MARL to optimize taxi dispatch and routing in real time, enhancing operational efficiency for electrical taxi.
