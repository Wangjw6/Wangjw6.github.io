Jiawei Wang is a postdoctoral researcher in the [Center for Spatial Information Science, The University of Tokyo](http://www.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/). He received a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/), supervised by [Prof. Lijun Sun](https://lijunsun.github.io/). His research connects machine learning with large-scale urban mobility systems, with a particular interest in creating deployable tools for cities and transit agencies.

## Research Focus
- Data- and AI-driven modeling of network-level traffic states
- Reinforcement learning for intelligent transit and mobility operations
- Behavior modeling of emerging multimodal and electrified fleets

### Data- and AI-driven Traffic Analysis
I develop interpretable learning pipelines that couple domain knowledge with deep neural architectures to provide reliable forecasts for complex transportation networks.
